1.Create Board  //fix colors, possibly create rows?  //fix drag (creates copies)
2.Objects?
3.Validate Moves
4.Win conditions
5.Kings
6.Refresh Board 



Ideas
1.Getting to the other side earns points
2.turns into peasant, jumps in between pieces

Problems
1.Copies comes from the one piece being used in the drag function. It happens when they cross their grouping. (Resolved)
2.Can drag piece into tile where there is already a tile, this destroys the piece, must prevent pieces from being placed directly on top of other pieces


Resolved:
1.Copies Resolved, each piece requires its own unique ID, otherwise each piece is the "same", creating the copy issue/random dissappearance
